## bob_quantum_skill

Alias skill for QCA generated-code quality policy, dual `.py` + `.ipynb` artifact generation, Qiskit/Python virtual environment readiness, dependency preflight, syntax validation, and clean execution behavior.

<!-- BQCA-v30-POLICY-REFERENCE-START -->
## BQCA Production Policy v30 — Authoritative Precedence
Use `.bob/BQCA-PRODUCTION-POLICY.md` as the authoritative appliance-wide
policy. Preserve the specialized intelligence of this mode, rule, skill, or tool,
but resolve routing, implementation, execution, security, and completion behavior
according to the v30 policy. Design artifacts go to `bob-quantum-designs/`;
implementation and result artifacts go to `bob-quantum-store/`. Legacy
implementation directories must never be used.
<!-- BQCA-v30-POLICY-REFERENCE-END -->

<!-- BQCA-CANONICAL-PRODUCTION-POLICY-v47:BEGIN -->
The sole active policy is `.bob/BQCA-PRODUCTION-POLICY.md` (v47). Direct execution must stream complete stdout/stderr live and write the exact professional report to `<source-stem>-result-output.txt` and `output.txt` beside the source. A real-QPU result places the actual Job ID on line one. Direct contract gaps are recorded as warnings; formal orchestration is explicit opt-in.
