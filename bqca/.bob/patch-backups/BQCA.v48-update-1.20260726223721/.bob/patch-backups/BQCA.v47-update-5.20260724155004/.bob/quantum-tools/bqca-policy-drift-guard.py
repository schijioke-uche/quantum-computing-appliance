# BQCA-CANONICAL-PRODUCTION-POLICY-v47:BEGIN
# BQCA v47 Update 4: follow .bob/BQCA-PRODUCTION-POLICY.md. Direct execution
# through bqca-direct-execution.sh is the default and must use the authorized
# home Python with unbuffered live stdout/stderr plus dual result capture.
# Code must preserve real-QPU-first plan-aware execution, controlled simulator
# fallback, and the required BQCA markers, including BQCA_RESULT=SUCCESS or
# BQCA_RESULT=FAILURE. The orchestrator is explicit opt-in only for formal
# compliance, deployment, or audit evidence. Direct-mode policy gaps are
# warnings that preserve the workload exit status; credential leakage blocks.
# This block supersedes conflicting local execution guidance.
