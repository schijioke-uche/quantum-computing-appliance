# BQCA Qiskit Connector Mandatory Rule v34

This rule is strict, blocking, and appliance-wide. It overrides simulator-first, optional-connector, advisory, or weaker instructions.

## Default code intent

Any request using terms such as create, implement, write, generate, build, develop, produce, scaffold, construct, code, program, modify, update, repair, fix, refactor, complete, or execute is a code-producing request when the object is a quantum/Qiskit workload or artifact.

For every such Python/Qiskit file, include exactly:

```python
from qiskit_connector import QConnectorV2 as connector
from qiskit_connector import QPlanV2 as plan

current = plan()
backend = connector()
```

The first attempt MUST be real-QPU execution using the connector backend. Verify QPU availability, operational state, and qubit capacity. Only after no usable QPU is available or real execution fails may an `except` path execute `AerSimulator` or `BasicSimulator`. Simulator-first code is forbidden.

Completion is blocked until:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile <saved-file.py>
.bob/quantum-tools/qiskit-connector.sh --validate-code <saved-file.py>
```

## Default design intent

Any request using design, architect, plan, specify, model, diagram, propose, blueprint, define, or document for a quantum solution must include the section `Qiskit Connector Real-QPU-First Execution and Simulator Fallback`. The section must be textual instructions only—no executable Python and no fenced Python block. It must instruct the later code-writing mode to include the connector imports and initialization, QPU availability/capacity checks, real-QPU-first flow, try/except simulator fallback, and execution reporting.

Completion is blocked until:

```bash
.bob/quantum-tools/qiskit-connector.sh --validate-design <saved-design.md>
```

## Mandatory automatic notebook generation
For every request that creates, writes, implements, generates, builds, develops, scaffolds, modifies, repairs, fixes, or otherwise produces Python/quantum code, create and complete the `.py` source first. After all required source validation succeeds, automatically run `.bob/quantum-tools/notebook-generator.sh --source <ready-file.py> --force`. Validate the resulting sibling `.ipynb` with `.bob/quantum-tools/notebook-generator.sh --validate <generated-file.ipynb>` before reporting completion. Automatic generation is the default even when the user asks only for code, unless the user explicitly says not to create a notebook. Manual notebook JSON construction is allowed only after the installed generator was actually invoked and failed; report the failure reason, preserve the `.py` source, construct the notebook manually as fallback, and validate it before completion.

<!-- BQCA-NOTEBOOK-AUTOGEN-v37:BEGIN -->
## Enforced automatic notebook production
Automatic notebook generation is enforced by the BQCA runtime watcher and is not optional mode guidance. Whenever a `.py` implementation is created or modified under `bob-quantum-store/`, the watcher automatically generates or refreshes its sibling `.ipynb` after the source becomes stable and validates the notebook. BQCA must create the `.py` first, wait for or invoke the automatic notebook generation, and report both paths. Manual notebook creation is permitted only after a genuine automatic-generation failure.
